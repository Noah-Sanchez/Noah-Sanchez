Hi, I’m @Noah-Sanchez

I'm a computer science freshman at ITESM, NL, Mexico, and an aficcionate pianist, martial arts practitioner and IT enthusiast.
I’m interested in OO programming, game development and IoT projects.  
I’m currently learning networking with ESP8266, 2D and 3D graphics with OpenGL and a real-time hardware graphics library of my own.
